The gradual release of responsibility instructional model (also known as the I do, We do, You do model) is a pedagogical technique developed by Pearson & Gallagher where students engage with material more independently over time. In this workshop, participants will learn how to apply the I do, We do, You do framework to teaching with Jupyter notebooks. Over the course of the workshop, participants will complete a series of exercises designed to help them use Jupyter notebooks more effectively support active learning in the classroom.
