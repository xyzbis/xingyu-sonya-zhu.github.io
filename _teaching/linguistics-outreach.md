**Linguistics Outreach ** 

These materials were developed for [Paws on Science](http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Research-Weekends/paws-on-science); an annual event put on by the Pacific Science Center to help UW scientists connect with the public. They were designed with an elementary-school audience in mind.

*   [Posters](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmtszkhoridy55a/postersEdited.pdf?dl=0) explaining the activities. I would recommend picking a maximum of three.
*   Sounds files for the [binaural](https://www.dropbox.com/s/or0p05cq0i1poo5/binaural.wav) listening and [phoneme replacement](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zfnfzxbb9s7win/phonemeReplacement.wav) activities.
*   Tables banners with QR links for the [PNWE project website](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1hm61sk4pochiz/pnweTent.pdf?dl=0), the [binaural](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szv8ghru7e3gh9b/binauralQrTent.pdf?dl=0) listening sound file and the [phoneme replacement](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ua7pdra2oxre9am/phonemeQrTent.pdf) sound file.
*   [Words](https://www.dropbox.com/s/omsor9oz0o933vu/sytnaxWords.pdf?dl=0) for the syntax tree. Cut them out, laminate them and place velcro dots on the backs of the words and the poster with the syntax tree.
*   You will also need:
    *   popsicle sticks/tongue depressors
    *   crepe paper
    *   head phones
    *   MP3 player
    *   easels or another way to mount posters
    *   (recommend) alcohol wipes for headphones
    *   (recommend) sanitizer
*   All art on these posters was labelled for commercial reuse with modification and you're free to use my materials (including recordings) for educational purposes.
